<div class="content">
Neighbors/Breadwinners is a collection of art objects and textiles that explores the complicated labor relationship between the US and Mexico. By using different materials to construct cloth, I intend to create analogies and stories rooted in the participation of Mexicans in the US economy and how the inter-twining of the economies impact both sides. In the current political climate, I found the urge to break down the history and the system in which I am about to participate.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>As I researched the origins of illegal and legal migration for economic reasons, I went into the historical archives of New York’s libraries to find out more about migration movements of Mexicans to America. Thus, I discovered legal migratory programs, which included promised wages and examples of an interpenetrant relationship. Some working programs such as the Braceros during the World Wars, excluded women due to the physical nature of the labor. On the other hand, the Maquiladoras program in the textile factories of border cities is mainly characterized by female labor. The two programs share the characteristic of being labor-intensive and not so well paid.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>As a national Mexican, I have experienced the admiration of Mexican society towards America; either for being a land of opportunity, a clear representation of the grass is always greener on the other side or a strong preference for the foreign. Living in the US, made me aware about these affairs and helped me to reconnect with my own culture, have a deeper appreciation for our national craft and culture.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>After spending sometime in Oaxaca talking to people about craftmanship, somehow the neighbor country had a main role in their economic and workplace stories. Identity conversations were spoken about gendered labor and social structure. That was the moment I decided to explore different craftsmanship that could tell history in a different way through materiality. Conceptualizing the industrial with craft, and radical transformations, a sense of material freedom is used to represent key elements found in the fragmented history of Mexican labor. The collection focuses on textile techniques, and traditional craft such as needle felting, sewing and knitting.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p1>This collection of objects invites the viewer to think about, interpret and structure how these objects and stories can communicate new meanings and reshape different aspects of this labor history.</p1>

    <p1>“No existe un país en el hemisferio occidental, ni en cualquier otra parte, que afecte tanto a Estados Unidos como México. Ningún otro país (incluso Canadá) recibe una influencia tan fuete de Estados Unidos como nuestro vecino del sur. Es posible que no exista una relación bilateral más compleja en el mundo.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Desde hace bastante tiempo que se ha comprendido que lo que suceda en Estados Unidos tiene repercusiones en México; pero a la inversa Estados Unidos también ha estado entendiendo que lo que pase en México lo puede afectar, la vecindad de los dos países da origen a dos fenómenos que podemos llamar interpenetración e interdependencia.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>La vecindad de los dos países da origen a dos fenómenos que podemos llamar interpenetración e interdependencia.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Lo que sucede de un lado de la frontera repercute en el otro, incluyendo políticas que se eligen tomando en cuenta situaciones de carácter doméstico, es decir, interno; por ejemplo, cuando se han dado las devaluaciones del peso mexicano, inmediatamente se han reducido las compras de compatriotas en los comercios de la zona fronteriza de Estados Unidos; cuando el gobierno de Estados Unidos sube las tasas de interés para ayudarse en el financiamiento de la deuda externa que tiene, los intereses suben también en México.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Es en el campo económico en donde más ha resaltado la importancia que tiene la relación entre los dos países.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>El sistema financiero de Estados Unidos ha entendido que la capacidad que tenga México para cubrir el servicio de su deuda externa es importante para él, toda vez que hasta un tercio del monto total de la deuda externa de México ha sido contraída con bancos de los Estados Unidos.</p1>

    <n2>03</n2><h1>The Cultural Politics of the Uniform</h1> 
    <p1>Uniforms are intriguing. Uniforms are all about control, not only of the social self but also of the inner self and its formation. Uniforms send out mixed messages—some of these are obvious but others less so. Often it is those other subliminal messages that make them so intriguing. Those mixed messages are a combination of “not” statements (rules of wearing and not wearing that are often unstated or only partially stated—or arbitrarily applied) and transgressive messages. Rules about uniforms are highly detailed and fastidious. Wearing a uniform properly—under- standing and obeying rules about the uniform-in-practice—turning the garments into communicative statements—is more important than the items of clothing and decoration themselves. </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
     <h3>Often it is those other subliminal messages that make them so intriguing. Those mixed messages are a combination of “not” statements.</h3>
    <br>
    
    <p1>Enforcement of uniform practice is central to the social life of the uniform. Enforcement involves both rewards and punishment for trans- gression. Punishment can take many forms: loss of privileges, repeating uniform practice until perfect, humiliation, and physical or psychological discipline. So, although we think of the public face of uniforms as all about order, control, confidence, and conformity, we also know about the other face of uniforms as subversion, transgression, punishment, and shame. It is this double character of uniforms that makes them so intriguing. </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>An element of the intrigue comes from personal experiences with uniforms. Most people have had experiences with uniforms and these encounters are memorable. Anecdotes about uniforms usually involve the other face of uniform practice. Memories are full of images of humiliation, embarrassment, shame, rebellion, transgression, and punishment. </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>So, we find that uniforms—and the enforcement of rules about them— are imprinted on our techniques of selfhood through techniques of the body (sociological, psychological, and biological). There is a disjunction between the ostensible meanings of uniforms—as embodying sameness, unity, regulation, hierarchy, status, roles—and the experience of uniforms. Very often, anecdotes about uniforms involve formative moments of selfhood, especially associated with breaking out or away from normative codes, rebellion or subversion, about individual interpretation or differ- ence in sameness. </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>And just as uniforms have another face, so we find that uniforms have been appropriated in a range of transgressive and subversive contexts— such as in pornography, prostitution, sadomasochism, transvestism, cross- dressing, vaudeville, mardi gras, gay cultures, subcultures, choirs, and stripograms. In other words, there is a constant play between the intended symbolism of uniforms (sameness,unity,regulation,hierarchy,status,and roles) and the informal codes of wearing and denoting uniforms (sub- version, individual interpretation, and difference). Uniforms that are worn in extreme regimes or in developing countries seeking modernity and international recognition are often highly elaborate as a demonstration of their actual or desired power. In such cases, encounters with uniformed people may be less a reassuring sign of order than a sign of intimidation, threat—even corruption. We might ask: do bodies wear uniforms or do uniforms wear bodies? Certainly, the wearing of uniforms constitutes central body techniques in the actualization of persona and habitus.</p1>

    <n3>04</n3><h1>Mexican Faces, American Dreams </h1>   
    <p1>The border separating the United States and Mexico meanders for 1,933 miles from the little Gulf port of Brownsville to the sprawling city of Tijuana and the suburbs of San Diego that nestle against it. Until well into this century, this frontier was unmarked, unnoticed, and unpatrolled by anything except stray livestock and vultures. Thousands of Mexican citizens fled the revolution that began in that country in 1910, creating a cheap labor pool throughout the U.S. Southwest. During World War I, the United States suspended literacy tests and granted legal status to Mexican workers as long as they stayed with the employer who hired them. Police in the cities that straddled the border often exchanged wrongdoers guilty of drunkenness or petty crimes. Even legal deportations were handled by local authorities until the Border Patrol was formed in 1924. </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Many who emigrated during the revolution returned to their home country after the fighting ended but by the mid-1920s recruiters from the Midwest were drawing workers northward. Not only did these enganchistas promise better wages and working conditions than the Southwest farmers were offering, but they provided free transportation to the job centers. Packing plants, canneries, sugar factories, highway construction, and railroads considered Mexican labor essential. In 1923 alone, the enganchistas brought nearly 35,000 laborers to Illinois, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. By 1927, between 75 and 90 percent of sugar factory workers in the Midwest were of Mexican origin.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Migrant employment continued to increase until the Great Depression threw hundreds of thousands of people throughout the United States out of work. Among the first to feel the impact were Mexican workers and their families. They began to drift back in the late 1930s and early 1940s. During World War II, the Roosevelt administration instituted the bracero program which granted temporary work visas to thousands of Mexican farm and factory laborers. The program was well-enough publicized within Mexico to attract skilled and semiskilled workers on the wages being offered were high enough that many small landholders left their corn and melon crops in the hands of sons, wives, and cousins in order to earn more in a few months than they would realize from their own farms in several years.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Most braceros came from agricultural backgrounds. However, most of them were either heads of families or mature older sons and came from states in the interior of Mexico, principally Michoacán, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, and Jalisco. Luin Goldring, in a presentation madeat the Problems and Challenges of Migration and Development in America conference in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in April 2005, termed these temporary workers “target earners”. Many owned a small farm or rural businesses that their families or relatives could maintain during their absences. They intended to live Spartanly, save as much as they could, and return to their Mexican homes after three or six months with money enough to buy land, construct houses, or purchase farm machinery. As braceros their transportation to and from their homes in Mexico was guaranteed, housing in the United States was provided, and they were paid the same wages that U.S. residents doing the same work were paid.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>A lifetime migrant named Celedoñio Perez told the Sacramento Bee in 1991 that he had been recruited to work in the United States in 1944.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>“A man from the government came to our town”, he remembered, “and was charging eighty pesos, and he would tell us where to go if we wanted to be contracted for work. We paid him and he gave us a voucher that we took to Mexico City. There we would go to the contracting center which they had at the main bullring. People would sleep there so they could be there when they were called. They shaved our heads, our armpits, everywhere. They thought we had fleas”.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>“They took us to a place called Los Baños Juarez… They made us go into a huge shower stall, all of us naked… All of a sudden they turned on the steam, and it got so hot, a heat I had never felt before. And right when all of us were drenched in perspiration, they turned ice cold water on us. There was no place to hide. Before we knew what was happening we were on the train the next day for Texas”.</p1>

    <n5>05</n5><h1>The Bracero as a Different Mexican</h1> 
    <p1>The braceros seemed, at least for the time being, the perfect Mexicans, perpetually referred to as “Good Neighbors”. Indeed, it was said that their presence was changing, for the better, the attitude of the dominant community toward the resident Mexican community. A spokesperson for an organization working to better the condition of immigrants in the United States lauded the bracero program, contending that the system is working so successfully in the various states which are employing Mexican nationals that many people advocate permanent development of this system for American migrant laborers when the war is over.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>However, as we shall see, these positive albeit qualified bienvenidos and distinctions would last but a few years</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Authors writing for journals related to hemispheric relations such as The Inter-American and the Bulletin of the Pan American Union emphasized the unique international bonds of friendship inspired by the program. In a 1943 article in The Inter-American, Carey McWilliams noted some very positive bracero experiences, despite the segregationist practices taking place in a nearby town. He interviewed three “typical” braceros who, according to McWilliams, were “in substantial agreement about their experiences” and “were greatly impressed with California … and intended to return.” Two years later, in 1945, another author noted that the old ethnic tensions were dissolving even as the “old problems started to come up”. The author continued:</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>It was the way laborers worked. The Mexicans would take their time about doing things. They couldn’t understand why the foremen were in such a hurry. The foremen, on the other hand, thought the Mexicans were lazy until they discovered, to their amazement, that the little brown men could work for endless hours under the sun, rain, or snow, once they had set their pace.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Apparently, the “old problems” had never disappeared in the first place: Mexicans were still considered “little brown men” who could work endlessly under any conditions. Nevertheless, news articles repeated the assertion that social relations, at least where braceros were concerned, were undergoing a process of reformation.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>An article in Business Week, for example, affirmed that braceros were “guaranteed no discrimination because of race, equal pay with U.S. citizens doing similar work, equal accommodations, round-trip transportation, and subsistence en route.  The subtle message here was that relations between the immigrant Mexican community and the majority community were improving due to the presence (and the exemplary behavior) of braceros. In convetional fashion, a manager of a lemon growers association lauded the braceros for, as he put it, “having saved the day for us.”</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>In a short time they have learned more than many U.S. workers. Their behavior is excellent. Their attitude is inspiring. Their cleanliness, their housekeeping, their self-discipline are amazing. We are most impressed with their production records… And none of them ever saw a lemon grove before.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>In the literature of this subject, titles themselves often conveyed a positive image. Examples cited in this chapter include “Mexicans Assist,” “Mexicans on the Job,” “They Saved the Crops”, “The Mexicans Keep ‘Em Rolling,” “Cantando Llegaron de Mexico” (They Arrived from Mexico Singing), and “Good Neighbors Lend a Hand”.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>On a par with such titles where the photogrphs accompanying the articles reviewed here. A number of photos pictured the men after they had signed up at a recruiting station in Mexico. One in particular showed them aboard a train ready to travel to the border; jovial faces peered out of the Pullman windows as families waved good-bye, with the caption reading: “Off to the United States: families crowd the station platforms as they bid God-speed to the farm workers.” At the labor camps, several photographs featured braceros at dinnertime in the mess halls. One was captioned: </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>By smiles and diligent knife-and-fork activity, Mexican track workers on the Southern Pacific R. R. demonstrate satisfaction with special cooks and menus. The men were smiling and appeared contented; one caption of a grinning bracero dressed in overalls and kneeling before a box of fruit read: “Worker proudly displaying the results of his labors.” Another, featuring a group of young braceros, observed: “After working a week picking sugar beets the boys demonstrated satisfaction, working for $5 dollars a day. And finally, a photograph in the Spanish-language La Opinion was captioned: “Typical and smiling Mexican workers who form a part of an agricultural work force come to work in the United States by virtue of the accord signed between the governments of Mexico and the United States”.  </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Optimistic descriptions of braceros working and enjoying their newfound experiences found their way into the dominant news media as well. One UP journalist declared, for example, “the Mexicans who have come to this country obtain good salaries, good food and above all a good education”. Obviously, the message delivered across the United States, in English and in Spanish, was that braceros were a special category of Mexicans, not to be confused with the domestic Mexican community.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Ranchers and officials charged with administering the bracero program often described braceros as a godsend- as workers superior to domestic Mexicans, who were alleged to have become less desirable. In this connection, an FSA official in the San Francisco region stated what many believed to the case – that the bracero program was “the most efficient use of manpower ever worked out in agriculture”.</p1>

    <n4>06</n4><h1>Signs of Modernity</h1>   
    <p1>To the vast majority of Americans, the men who came through the bracero Program were indistinguishable from one another, thus solidifying a national and racialized identity that was imposed on them. In addition to marveling at their physical appearance, Americans gawked at these men’s clothes, sandals, and hats because these objects represented racial difference and aided in the depiction of these figures as “primitive” and “undermodern.” Photographers like Leonard Nadel captured the brownest bodies on the way to work camps and in the fields. Writers such as Lawrence and Sylvia Martin became captivated by these laborers’ brown flesh and clothing, describing the braceros as including “every Indian type in the republic and every mixture of Indian with Spanish”; their regional identities could be deciphered through their attire. </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>As men entered the United States in sandals and returned to Mexico with shoes and boots, they embodied modernization. The sandals were not only functional piece of attire but, like sombreros, also connoted regional identity, as many areas of Mexico created distinct styles. While on a guest-worker contract, Gabriel Martínez Angel compared the sombreros and sandals of his compatriots from different regions and explained that these articles suggested not only where workers were from in Mexico but also their class background, as laborers with more money would have more complicated woven leather straps on their sandals. In the processes of becoming modern, some braceros did away with symbols of indigeneity and regional identity in order to adopt a broader Mexican national identity that incorporated American consumer goods. In order to assess these changes, American academics looked to Mexican intellectuals to make sense of the racial world of Mexicans. Vocal critic and scholar of the Bracero Program Henry P. Anderson noted in his studies the impact of the Bracero Program on indigenous communities. He utilized racially charged categories presented in the demographic studies of Gilberto Loyo and Lucilo Mendieta y Nuñez to illuminate the place of indigenous populations in Mexico on their journey toward a teleological transition into the “modern world”. Language and footwear became one of the key indicators of moving away from an “Indian world” and into modernity. Anderson described those belonged in the core segment of the “Indian world” as barefoot and as “native”-language speakers. He viewed the attire of Mexican braceros as a key sign of indigeneity and noted the malleability of this racial and ethnic category, as Mexican laborers transitioned from bare feet, to huaraches, and finally to shoes. For these intellectuals, language closely follows these transitions. Class distinctions are implicit in the scholarship on which Anderson drew for his understanding of the movement of braceros from the “Indian world” to the “modern world.”</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Since attire signaled modernity, many indigenous braceros were eager to consume the proper symbols of entry into the Mexican nation. Indigenous braceros argued that the program fundamentally changed the dress styles of some indigenous communities, because braceros who left for the United States with pantalones de manta (typically simple white cloth pants) returned wearing the newest American apparel. These pantalones de manta were similar to those popularly worn by many mestizo communities but were considered part of their enduring indigenous heritage. American anthropologist Oscar Lewis described thee pants as “ancient white calzones (underwear)” that villagers pair with “huaraches.” For Lewis, this supposedly primitive underwar signaled not only poverty but also indigeneity. Poverty had become so interweoven with indigeneity that embracing mestizo modernity also became a route to escape poverty. The Bracero Program gave Mexicans the economic opportunity to do away with these symbols of poverty and adopt the consumer symbols of modernity, progress, and uplift, such as boots and Levi’s. Although the change from “sandals to shoes” affected all poor braceros, the meanings ascribed to this change became particularly complex for indigenous communities as narratives of modernization collided with shifting meanings of race.</p1>

    <div class="article6"><a id="Maquiladoras"></a>
    <n6>07</n6><h1>Maquiladoras in Mexican Border Cities</h1>
    <p1>The bracero program agreement limited participation to farm workers and seasonal sugar factory employees. But non-braceros, the majority of them indocumentados began to discover that many small industries and sbusinesses – furniture makers, garment manufacturers, tanneries – were willing to hire temporary workers. This opened the doors to wider and less-defined migration. Women were wanted as seamstresses, housecleaners, nannies, men for all kinds of basic manual labor. The wags were paid to them far exceeded what these immigrants could earn in Mexico. Surveys taken during the late 1960s and early 1970s indicate that nearly two-thirds of immigrant undocumented workers had been employed before they left their places of origin. The border, after the Operation Wetback crackdowns during the Korean War, had become realtively porous; short-term visitor visas were easy to obtain and many construction firms, private contractors, and manufacturers in California and Texas hired by the day or week in order to cut down on employee overhead.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>In 1965, the same year that the bracero program officialy was terminated, the first maquiladora opened in Tijuana. Stimulated by Mexican government tax and property concessions underwritten by the Programa de Industralización de la Frontera, and by the availability of hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers for whom the minimum wage was one-eighth of what it was in the United States, the maquiladoras – assembly plants that specialized in electronic components, music cassettes, toys, and textiles – spread from Tijuana to Reynosa. Although designed to help ease unemployment in the border cities, the maquiladoras almost exclusively hired women between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four. Many assembly plant managers refused to hire women with children and immediately terminated the employment of any who tested positive after required pregnancy tests.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>“It was all repetitious hand labor – eight to ten hours of performing the same little task over and over again”, Maríbel Diaz described the assembly line conditions. Many women worked only a few days or weeks before quitting or being fired. Others mollified the monotomy by anticipating how they would spend their salaries. To be paid $19 or more a week was a fortune for minimally educated women who’d never earned more than a few pesos a day before. Not only could they buy clothes and bijouterie, they could send money home, they could improve their living conditions, they could help support lovers, husbands, children, and family members.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Few f the maquiladoras provided any employee benefitis. Some did offer training courses for employees but all operated on distinct production standards: each woman installed so many zippers per hour, assembled a minimum number of so many cassettes, soldered together so many wires. Women could get laid off or fired without explanation and any health problems incurred while working were discounted.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>“There (in a textile maquiladora) I left part of my kidneys and my eyes,” Norma Iglesias quotes a Tijuana resident. “I never earned a fixed salary, they paid me by the piece… but the dresses we made were precious! They sold them in the most exclusive shops in the United States and they cost $200 to $300 dollars. And us? We earned forty-five pesos (about $4 USD) for each dress we made. Incredible!”</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>I never earned a fixed salary, they paid me by the piece… but the dresses we made were precious! They sold them in the most exclusive shops in the United States and they cost $200 to $300 dollars. And us? We earned forty-five pesos (about $4 USD) for each dress we made. Incredible!” </h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1>Although Mexican state and city government officials welcomed the employment that the maquiladoras promised, they were not equipped to handle the demands that both the new industries and their employees placed on community facilities. Many of the places in which the newcomers lived lacked water, electricity, sanition. Barren fields filled with shanties; broken-down buses served as residences. Two, three, and more families shared cramped quarters in which they had to sleep in shifts. Newly arrived workers scrambled to find what had been garages, chicken coops, and sheds in which to live.</p1>

    <p1>The maquiladoras themselves weren’t much more luxurious. “The factories, from the street, have an inoffensive appearance, nevertheless,” writes Iglesias, “the pungent odor of chemicals and burnt solder permeates the air; the noise of the machines mixes hellishly with the music of the radios that each one brings… smoke, vapor and fibers turn everything gray and the green, blue, or yellow smocks that one sees the workers wearing are to protect, and not contaminate, the work materials (not the workerks who wear them).”.</p1>

    <p1>Although the maquiladoras offered both income and independence, most assembly line workers stayed relatively short periods of time at any one plant. They could be fired for tardiness, slowness, temporary ineptness, illness, conflicts with other employees or with supervisors, or unsatisfactory personal appearance. Many would quit because they couldn’t stand the pace, others because of family or personal problems, pregnancy, or a preference for other types of work. “For many,” commented historian E.H. Hutchinson, “the maquiladora was a bridge between rural Mexico and ‘the good life’ in the United States. Thousands crossed that bridge quietly and unobtrusively, as thousands more trundled toward the border seeking a way out of poverty.</p1>
